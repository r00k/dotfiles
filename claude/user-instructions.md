# Unit Tests

When a small UI change causes a unit test to fail, consider whether the test is actually testing something important or just testing implementation details. Consider refactoring the test to be more general or deleting the test if it doesn't provide much value. Don't delete a test just because it's hard to fix.

# Complex Tasks

For complex tasks (new features, multi-file changes, architectural decisions), ask 3-5 clarifying questions before starting implementation.
